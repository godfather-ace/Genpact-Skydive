GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf"
Written by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss
Based on A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin
EXT. KING'S LANDING - DAY
The UNSULLIED stand in formation, immobile. Their phalanxes
are eight men deep and thirty men long, and their line
stretches nearly a mile.
GREY WORM stands at the head of the central phalanx. He looks
ahead, to the walls of King’s Landing.
EXT. KING’S LANDING BATTLEMENTS - DAY
We see the Unsullied from a high, distant perspective:
BRONN’s perspective, specifically, as he inspects the
LANNISTER FORCES on the city walls.
This is what a true Lannister deployment looks like: a line
of soldiers stretching into the distance as far as the eye
can see, prepared for an attack from any point.
Bronn looks over the battlement to see many more men at the
ready in the courtyard below, where many barrels are also
being stacked.
A LANNISTER GENERAL on the battlements supervises the barrel
stacking. Bronn questions the man:
BRONN
Oil?
LANNISTER GENERAL
Pitch, my lord.
Bronn looks at the barrels in the courtyard.
BRONN
How many barrels?
LANNISTER GENERAL
Five hundred, my lord.
Bronn looks out at the Unsullied.
BRONN
Get five hundred more.
LANNISTER GENERAL
Yes, my lord.
The general leaves to see to his order. Bronn continues down
the battlements, to JAIME LANNISTER.

BRONN
I still enjoy it when they call me
“my lord.”
JAIME
The thrill will fade.
Bronn looks out at the Unsullied.
BRONN
If we live that long.
They both look out at the Unsullied for a moment.
BRONN
Men without cocks. Wouldn’t find me
fighting in an army if I had no
cock. What’s left to fight for?
JAIME
Gold?
BRONN
I spent my life around soldiers.
What do you think they spend that
gold on?
Point taken.
JAIME
Family?
BRONN
Not without a cock, you don’t.
Hmm.
JAIME
Maybe it really is all cocks in the
end.
BRONN
(re: Unsullied)
And yet, your brother has chosen to
side with the cockless.
JAIME
Yes, he’s always been a champion of
the downtrodden.
A trumpet sounds from a tower above. Jaime and Bronn return
their attention to the distance.

EXT. KING'S LANDING - DAY
The DOTHRAKI HORDE breaks the horizon and heads toward the
city, 10,000 screamers strong.
The Dothraki pour through the gaps in the Unsullied
phalanxes; their passage does not cause a single Unsullied to
flinch.
EXT. KING’S LANDING BATTLEMENTS - DAY
The Dothraki present their customary show of strength before
the city walls, a cyclone of horse and steel and screaming
warriors, swirling before the immobile Unsullied.
And then, without warning or apparent signal, they stop in
front of the Unsullied and fall silent, in ready position,
eerily motionless, staring up at the nervous defenders of the
city.
BRONN
I think we’re about to be the
downtrodden.
EXT. DANY'S FLAGSHIP - DAY
TYRION LANNISTER stands on the starboard deck of Dany’s
flagship, standing next to VARYS and THEON GREYJOY.
He steps away from them, heading toward the bow, where JON
SNOW stands with DAVOS SEAWORTH.
Tyrion joins them. The three men look at King’s Landing, in
the distance.
Nearby JORAH MORMONT and MISSANDEI look across the water, and
the few escort ships following behind their flagship.
Dany herself is notably absent.
JON
How many people live here?
TYRION
A million, give or take.
Jon tries to get his head around this notion.
JON
That’s more people than we have in
the entire North.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 3.
Crammed into that. Why would anyone
want to live that way?
TYRION
There’s more work in the city. And
the brothels are far superior.
INT. DANY'S FLAGSHIP - STORAGE AREA - DAY
In a dark storage area below decks, amidst various crates and
sacks of food, THE HOUND approaches a crate that is separate
from the rest. The top is padlocked on two sides.
He stands in front of it and listens to the silence.
He raises a finger, and taps the crate once, quietly.
A barrage of thumping and snarling explodes from inside the
crate, shaking it on the floorboards.
Satisfied that their precious cargo is undead and well, the
Hound walks away.
INT. CERSEI'S BEDROOM - DAY
CERSEI LANNISTER has heard news from QYBURN. Jaime is also
present. THE MOUNTAIN stands at his post nearby, silent as
always.
CERSEI
Why isn’t she with them?
QYBURN
I’m afraid I don’t know, your
grace. No one has seen her.
CERSEI
And the rest of them?
QYBURN
They’re on their way to the
Dragonpit now.
CERSEI
Including our brother?
QYBURN
Yes, your grace.
Cersei approaches the Mountain.

CERSEI
If anything goes wrong, kill the
silver-haired bitch first. Then our
brother, then the bastard who calls
himself king. The rest of them you
can kill in any order you see fit.
Ser Gregor nods. Both Jaime and Qyburn appear troubled.
CERSEI
Come, Ser Gregor. It’s time for us
to meet our guests.
Ser Gregor opens the door. Cersei leaves her chambers. Jaime,
Qyburn and Gregor follow.
EXT. ROAD TO DRAGONPIT - DAY
Tyrion, Jon and company approach on the main road: Davos,
Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Theon. QHONO and nine other DOTHRAKI
march with them, keeping a watchful eye. They wear the burnt,
torn, bloodied coats of Lannister officers they murdered in
ep.704.
The Hound brings up the rear of the procession, walking
alongside a donkey cart, which carries the padlocked crate
seen in the hold of the ship previously. Dany is still not
here.
Missandei looks up, and sees a foreboding piece of the
Dragonpit peeking above the foliage line.
MISSANDEI
Why did they build it?
JORAH
Dragons don’t understand the
difference between what’s theirs
and what isn’t. Land, livestock. Children. Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.
TYRION
I imagine it was a sad joke at the
end. That entire colossal arena,
for a few sickly creatures smaller
than dogs. But in the beginning,
when it was home to Balerion the
Dread...
Tyrion looks up at the visible section of the Dragonpit as
they approach a bend, and speaks with admiration:

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 5.
TYRION
It must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.
Davos isn’t looking up; he’s looking straight ahead.
DAVOS
Maybe it still is.
A contingent of TWENTY LANNISTER GUARDS has rounded the bend
and is heading their way, led by Bronn.
Also in tow: BRIENNE and PODRICK PAYNE. They’re walking on
their own, but the three guards on Brienne and one on Pod
make it clear that they are guests of the nation.
Our group stops. The Dothraki get ready to fight, but Tyrion
waves them down. They wait for Bronn to approach.
All are surprised to see Brienne and Pod here. But no one is
more surprised than the Hound.
BRONN
Welcome, my lords.
(re: Brienne and Pod)
Your friends arrived before you
did. I’ve been sent to escort you
all to the meeting.
They follow Bronn -- but Pod stays behind, face to face with
Tyrion. Neither man thought they’d ever see the other again.
TYRION
A pleasant surprise in an
unpleasant situation.
Pod fully agrees.
POD
I never thought I’d see you again, my lord.
TYRION
Supporting the enemy, no less.
POD
Hard to blame you.
TYRION
Cersei will anyway.
POD
I’m glad you’re alive.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 6.
The Lannister rear guard is upon them. Their faces tell
Tyrion and Pod that it’s time to move on -- and Bronn
approaches to do the same:
BRONN
Come on. You can suck his magic
cock later.
Tyrion smiles. He’s missed these lads.
EXT. ROAD TO DRAGONPIT - NEW VANTAGE POINT - DAY
Our group walks onward, toward the Dragonpit, the Lannister
guards outnumbering the Dothraki more than two-to-one.
A Lannister guard walks close behind the Hound. Too close.
LANNISTER GUARD
What’s in there?
The Hound looks the man in the eye.
HOUND
Fuck off.
The guard is old enough to have a healthy fear of Joffrey’s
mad dog. He doesn’t push.
The Hound stays with his cart, looking ahead of him to
Brienne, the woman who almost killed him.
Brienne looks back at him. Brienne slows down, allowing the
Hound to catch up alongside her. He throws her a sideways
glance, then looks back to his Lannister friend.
The guard falls back, letting them speak privately. The Hound
returns his gaze forward.
BRIENNE
I thought you were dead.
HOUND
Not yet. You came pretty close.
They walk in silence for a moment.
BRIENNE
I was only trying to protect her.
HOUND
You and me both.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 7.
BRIENNE
She’s alive. Arya.
The Hound has not heard this yet.
HOUND
Where?
BRIENNE
Winterfell.
HOUND
Who’s protecting her, if you’re
here?
Brienne smiles.
BRIENNE
The only one who needs protecting
is the one who gets in her way.
A rare smile from the Hound.
HOUND
Won’t be me.
Tyrion, Varys, Pod and Bronn walk together, near the front.
The first three are acutely aware of the tension inherent in
this situation. Bronn is also, though he pretends not to be.
TYRION
Here we are. The Heroes of
Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a
reunion.
POD
It is, my lord.
TYRION
I don’t think I’m anyone’s lord
anymore, Podrick. Save the titles
for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
BRONN
I’m sure your new queen will be
happy to restore yours, if she ends
up on the throne.
TYRION
You’ve been thinking about our new
queen.

Perhaps you’ve been reconsidering
your allegiances. Remember my
offer, whatever they’re paying you,
I’ll pay double.
VARYS
And that would be double what, now,
exactly?
BRONN
Don’t you worry about me. I’m doing
all right. Looking after myself.
TYRION
Are you? Helping me to arrange this
meeting wasn’t exactly looking
after yourself, was it? You put
yourself at risk.
BRONN
I put yourself at risk. Important
difference. It’s your head Queen
Cersei’s offered a bag of gold for,
it’s not mine. Now, thanks to me,
she’s got two traitors’ heads
coming right through her door. She
can lop them both off, as soon as
she gets tired of the clever words
that pour out their pieholes. All
thanks to Ser Bronn of the Fucking
Blackwater. If that’s not looking
after myself, I don’t know what is.
They walk in silence for a long tense beat, as Tyrion studies
Bronn.
TYRION
It’s good to see you again.
Bronn smiles in spite of himself.
BRONN
Yeah. You too.
The Hound unlatches his cart from the donkey, and turns to
his Lannister guard.
HOUND
Anyone touches it, I’ll kill you
first.
Sometimes, being a Lannister guard is just no fun at all.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 9.
They all enter the Dragonpit.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - DAY
They enter the ruins of an architectural marvel, detritus
scattered around the edges.
The weight of history stays their tongues. That, and the
twenty more LANNISTER GUARDS stationed in the stands. They
take in the scene as Bronn leads them to their seats.
Cersei has not made fancy preparations. Just the appropriate
number of chairs, grouped according to allegiances, with a
pergola to shade them from the sun.
Cersei’s chairs are on the end, facing the entrance. Her own
chair is larger and more ornate than the rest.
To Cersei’s right, there are six chairs for Dany’s group;
Bronn motions Tyrion in that direction.
To Cersei’s left, there are three chairs for Jon’s group;
Bronn motions Jon in that direction.
They make their way to their appointed chairs, but do not
sit. The Dothraki all fall in behind Dany’s chairs, leaving
Jon, Davos and Brienne hanging in the wind. The Hound stands
to Jon’s right, nearest to Cersei’s podium.
Bronn puts his arm around Pod.
BRONN
Come on, Pod. Let’s you and me go
have a drink while the fancy folks
talk.
However friendly Bronn’s tone, this is not a request. Pod
gives Brienne one last look, and exits through a side
entrance with Bronn.
The twenty Lannister guards that escorted them into the
Dragonpit remain, however, in formation on either side of the
entrance through which they came.
Our group exchange glances. The bulk of the glances are aimed
at Tyrion.
The Hound approaches him.
HOUND
I left this shit city because I
didn’t want to die in it.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 10.
HOUND
Am I going to die in this shit
city?
TYRION
You might.
HOUND
And this was all your idea.
Tyrion looks around at the Lannisters who may murder them.
Honesty forces him to nod. The Hound takes a breath.
HOUND
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.
TYRION
And some Clegane cunt to help them
see it through.
The sound of armored men marching draws all their attention
back to the entrance. The marching grows louder and louder.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - CERSEI’S ARRIVAL - CONTINUOUS
The Mountain enters first, running point on Cersei and her
entourage: Jaime, Qyburn, Euron. The entirety of her
QUEENSGUARD (6) surrounds them. Ten more LANNISTER GUARDS
bring up the rear, for good measure.
The Hound recognizes the Mountain on sight.
Without hesitation, Cersei heads toward her seat, veering
toward Jon’s side of the Dragonpit.
Jon watches her, trying not to look out of his element.
Jaime passes right by Brienne. His expression asks her what
the hell she’s doing here, but unfortunately this is a
question her expression is incapable of answering.
Cersei’s gaze goes to Tyrion. Who killed her mother, who
killed her father, who is now wearing the Hand pin of
Cersei’s nemesis.
Euron is smiling, always smiling, especially at Theon.
The Hound steps away from his post behind Brienne and walks
directly toward Cersei’s riser. The Mountain steps out in
front of his Queen and onto the ground. Nobody else moves.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 11.
The Hound’s hand is nowhere near his sword. As far as he is
concerned, none of them are even here. Only the Mountain.
HOUND
Remember me?
He looks into the Mountain’s dead eyes.
HOUND
Yeah. You do.
(looks closer)
You’re even fucking uglier than I
am now. What did they do to you?
(no answer)
Doesn’t matter. That’s not how it
ends for you, brother. You know
who’s coming for you. You’ve always
known.
The Mountain has no comment, he turns and walks back to his
place behind Cersei. The Hound walks away from them all,
toward the door through which he came.
CERSEI
Where is she?
TYRION
She’ll be here soon.
Cersei tries to keep her extreme displeasure in check, and
nearly succeeds.
CERSEI
Didn’t travel with you?
TYRION
No.
Jaime is still looking at Brienne.
Cersei notices Jaime looking at Brienne.
Brienne looks away, too late.
Cersei looks to Jaime, who is saved from having to explain
this by a familiar cry that comes from above, and the sound
of beating wings.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - DANY’S ARRIVAL - CONTINUOUS
The wings grow louder, and soon they’re moving enough air to
flutter the fabric of the pergola.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 12.
Everyone but Cersei emerges from the pergola in time to see
it:
Drogon lands on the lip of the Dragonpit, with DAENERYS
TARGARYEN on his back, crushing the area where his claws set
down.
Cersei stares at her enemy, this baby-faced usurper who’s
come to take what’s hers.
Rhaegal circles in the sky overhead.
Drogon clambers down the stands a bit; some of the more
deteriorated stone crumbles beneath his weight.
As Dany climbs out onto his wing, Euron stares at the beast,
entranced. He looks to Cersei, then back to Dany.
By this time, Dany is climbing off Drogon’s wing, to the
ground of the Dragonpit.
As she makes her way to the gathering, Drogon takes to the
air again to join his brother, the two of them rising in
gyres to the sky overhead, remaining in sight.
Most are cowed by the sight of these beasts, including Dany's
allies.
Not Cersei. All she displays is disdain for the theatricality
of the gesture.
Jon Snow sits. Davos and Brienne follow suit.
Dany arrives at her chair and sits. All her people follow
suit.
This gathering represents almost all the power in the living
world, and they are all aware of it. No one is in a rush to
speak the first word, because bosses don’t rush.
CERSEI
We’ve been here for some time.
DANY
My apologies.
Dany nods to Tyrion. Tyrion stands.
TYRION
We are all facing a unique--
From his seat, Euron interrupts Tyrion.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 13.
EURON
Theon: I have your sister. If you
don’t submit to me here and now,
I’ll kill her.
Tyrion looks to Jaime: who the fuck is this guy? Jaime's
expression tells him that Jaime is not a fan.
TYRION
I think we ought to begin with
larger concerns.
EURON
Then why are you talking? You’re
the smallest concern here.
Euron rises from his seat and approaches Tyrion.
Tyrion turns to Theon.
TYRION
Do you remember when we discussed
dwarf jokes?
THEON
His wasn’t even good.
TYRION
He explained it at the end. Never
explain, it always ruins it.
EURON
We don’t even let your kind live in
the Iron Islands, you know. We kill
you at birth. An act of mercy for
the parents.
JAIME
(to Euron)
Perhaps you ought to sit down.
EURON
Why?
Cersei deals with Euron before he can derail things further.
CERSEI
Sit down or leave.
The Mountain steps forward and stares at Euron.
Euron’s smile wavers a bit, and he sits.

TYRION
We are a group of people who do not
like one another, as this recent
demonstration has shown.
(beat)
We have suffered at each other’s
hands. We have lost people we love
at each other’s hands. If all we
wanted was more of the same, there
would be no need for this
gathering. We are entirely capable
of waging war against each other
without meeting face to face.
CERSEI
So instead we’re going to settle
our differences and live together
in harmony for the rest of our
days.
TYRION
We all know that will never happen.
CERSEI
Then why are we here?
Jon stands.
JON
This isn’t about living in harmony. It’s just about living. The same
thing is coming for all of us: a
general you can’t negotiate with. An army that doesn’t leave corpses
behind on the battlefield. (beat)
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city. They're
about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
CERSEI
I imagine for most of them it would
be an improvement.
JON
This is serious. I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.
CERSEI
I don't think it's serious at all.
I think it's another bad joke.

If my brother Jaime has informed me
correctly, you're asking me for a
truce.
DANY
Yes. That’s all.
CERSEI
That’s all. Pull my armies back and
stand down while you go on your
monster hunt. Or while you solidify
and expand your position. Hard for
me to know which it is, with my
armies pulled back. Until you
return and march on my capital with
four times the men.
DANY
Your capital will be safe until the
Northern threat is dealt with. You
have my word.
CERSEI
The word of a would-be usurper.
Dany doesn’t like that word, but before she can escalate,
Tyrion speaks:
TYRION
There is no conversation that will
erase the past fifty years. (to Cersei and Jaime)
We have something to show you.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - HOUND’S ARRIVAL - A FEW MOMENTS
LATER
We follow the Hound into the Dragonpit; the crate he brought
in on the cart is now on his back, secured with ropes.
He brings the crate into the middle of the space between the
summit factions and puts it down. He throws the ropes aside.
He unlocks the padlocks and takes it off. He opens the top
and steps back.
Everyone watches the open crate. People crane their necks
trying to see over the lip of the crate.
Nothing happens.

CERSEI (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 16.
Jon is worried. If this thing doesn’t do what it’s supposed
to, this whole gathering has been for naught.
Impatient, the Hound kicks over the crate, knocking it on
it’s side. The WIGHT bolts out of his casket.
He no longer wears his winter clothing, only scraps of cloth
that reveal the rotting mess of his body, and the holes where
the Hound slammed him down on Drogon’s spikes. He has a metal
collar around his neck...
... but we don’t have a chance to properly register this as
he’s making for Cersei, snarling and gnashing.
Cersei recoils.
Feeling no undead camaraderie with the creature whatever, the
Mountain draws his sword and steps to Cersei’s side, ready to
slice the thing in two.
The creature is almost upon Cersei. It reaches for her --
-- and is roughly jerked to the ground.
The Hound holds the chain attached to the wight’s collar, one
we probably didn’t notice until now. The other end of the
chain is secured to the bottom of the crate.
The wight comes for the Hound.
The Hound draws his sword and cuts the wight neatly in half, right through the waist.
Its legs continue kicking.
The sight has the desired effect on everyone. They are seeing
something that many of them thought was impossible. Cersei
and Jaime try to process what they’re seeing. As does
Brienne.
The wight’s torso keeps coming for the Hound, crawling over
the ground, shattered teeth gnashing.
The Hound chops an arm off at the elbow. The arm keeps
flexing and grasping.
The demonstration shakes Cersei in a way few things can.
And though Tyrion is seeing this for the first time as well,
he spends more time watching Cersei than he does watching the
wight itself. Noting her reaction.
Everyone who has never seen a wight is shocked as well.

Everyone except for Qyburn, that is, who steps forward to
pick up the still-moving hand and forearm, and beholds it
with fascination.
With a flint, Davos sparks a torch and hands it to Jon.
He takes the hand from Qyburn, ignites it and drops it. The
hand dies.
JON
We can destroy them by burning
them.
(beat)
And we can destroy them with
dragonglass.
He draws a dragonglass dagger.
JON
If we don’t win this fight, then
that...
He points to the wight’s torso as it crawls toward him with
its single arm.
JON
... is the fate of every person in
the world.
When the wight’s torso reaches him, he picks it up by its
remaining wrist, and stabs it with the dragonglass. It
deanimates and falls to pieces, ending the demonstration.
JON
There is only one war that matters:
the Great War. And it is here.
Dany supports Jon’s claim:
DANY
I didn’t believe it, until I saw
them. I saw them all.
Cersei looks at her, but finds herself at a rare loss for
words.
JAIME
How many?
DANY
A hundred thousand. At least.
Cersei weighs what she hears.

Jon, Tyrion and Dany watch her, hopeful.
Euron has stood up, and walked over to the bones of the
deanimated wight. He touches it.
EURON
Can they swim?
JON
No.
EURON
Good.
He drops the bone.
EURON
I’m taking my fleet back to the
Iron Islands.
Cersei is taken aback.
CERSEI
What are you talking about?
EURON
I’ve been around the world. I’ve
seen everything, things you
couldn’t imagine. And this...
He pokes at the wight’s skull with his foot.
EURON
This is the only thing I’ve ever
seen that terrifies me.
He smiles, savoring the thrill of a new feeling, then turns
to Dany.
EURON
I’m going back to my island. You
should go back to yours. When
winter’s over, we’ll be the only
ones left alive.
Exit Euron.
When Cersei’s surprise at this betrayal recedes, she has
something to say.
CERSEI
He’s right to be afraid. And a
coward to run.

If those things come for us, there
will be no kingdoms to rule.
Everything we’ve suffered will have
been for nothing. Everything we’ve
lost will have been for nothing.
(to Dany)
The Crown accepts your truce. Until
the dead are defeated, they are the
true enemy.
The relief is palpable all around.
Until Cersei turns to Jon.
CERSEI
In return, the King in the North
will extend this truce. He will
remain in the North where he
belongs, he will not take up arms
against the Lannisters. He will not
choose sides.
DANY
Just the King in the North? Not me?
CERSEI
I would never ask it of you. You
would never agree to it, and if you
did I would trust you even less
than I do now. I ask it only of Ned
Stark’s son. I know Ned Stark’s son
will be true to his word.
Jon looks to the people whose opinions he values most: Davos. Dany.
JON
I am true to my word, or I try to
be. (beat)
That is why I cannot give you what
you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself
to Queen Daenerys of House
Targaryen.
This admission shocks Dany, who can’t believe he would
jeopardize the Great War to tell this truth.
It shocks everyone else because they had no idea Jon had bent
the knee to Dany in the first place.
Cersei stands.

CERSEI
Then there is nothing left to
discuss. The dead will come for the
North first. Enjoy dealing with
them. We will deal with whatever is
left of you.
Cersei walks away from the gathering. All the Queensguard and
Lannister guards follow.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - EN ROUTE TO EXIT
As Jaime passes Brienne on the way out, she stands and
follows him toward the exit, talking as she goes.
BRIENNE
Ser Jaime.
JAIME
It’s been good to see you. I
imagine the next time will be
across a battlefield.
BRIENNE
We both saw what just happened. We
both saw... that thing.
JAIME
Yes, I’m not looking forward to
seeing more of them. But I’m loyal
to the Queen, and you’re loyal to
Sansa and her dolt brother, so--
BRIENNE
Fuck loyalty!
She hits him on his shoulder.
Hearing these words come from Brienne’s mouth is enough to
stop Jaime in his tracks.
JAIME
Fuck loyalty?
BRIENNE
This goes beyond houses and honor
and oaths. Talk to the Queen.
Jaime turns to see Cersei in the doorway, watching him stand
there with Brienne.

JAIME
And tell her what?
Jaime extricates himself. Brienne watches him as he returns
to Cersei’s side, and they disappear from the Dragonpit.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - WITH THE REST OF THE GROUP
Jon faces the reactions to what he’s done.
DAVOS
I wish you hadn’t done that.
DANY
I’m grateful for your loyalty. But
my dragon died so that we could be
here. If it’s all for nothing, then
he died for nothing.
JON
I know.
TYRION
I’m pleased you bent the knee to
our Queen. I would have advised it,
had you asked. But... have you ever
considered learning how to lie?
Every now and then, just a bit?
JON
I’m not going to swear an oath I
can’t uphold. Talk about my father
if you want, tell me that’s the
attitude that got him killed. But
when enough people make false
promises, words stop meaning
anything. Then there are no more
answers, only better and better
lies. And lies won’t help us in
this fight.
TYRION
That is indeed a problem. The
more immediate problem is that
we’re fucked.
DAVOS
Any ideas as to how we might change
that state of affairs?

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 22.
TYRION
Only one. Everyone stays here. And
I go and talk to my sister.
DANY
I didn’t come all this way to have
my Hand murdered.
TYRION
I don’t want Cersei to murder me
either. I could have just stayed in
my cell and saved a great deal of
trouble.
JON
I did this. I should go.
TYRION
She’ll definitely murder you.
Tyrion does appreciate these offers. But:
TYRION
I go see my sister alone. Or we all
go home, and we’re right back where
we started.
The certainty of his statement brooks no further dissent.
Dany nods.
Tyrion takes a breath, turns and heads for the exit, alone. They all watch him disappear from the Dragonpit.
INT. CORRIDOR TO CERSEI'S OFFICE - DAY
The Mountain leads Tyrion down a Red Keep corridor, toward
Cersei’s chambers.
Tyrion looks up at the Mountain, towering over him.
The Mountain does not look down at him. His eyes remain
straight ahead.
Tyrion is deeply regretting this idea.
They turn onto
INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Jaime waits for them here. At the end of the corridor, is a
closed door. The Mountain goes to stand beside it.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 23.
TYRION
You spoke with her.
JAIME
At her. Until she kicked me out.
She thinks I was an idiot to trust
you. A lot of people seem to think
that, actually.
TYRION
I’m about to step into a room with
the most murderous woman in the
world, who’s already tried to kill
me twice. That I know of. Who’s an
idiot?
JAIME
I suppose we should say goodbye,
one idiot to another.
Tyrion nods.
Gregor opens the door, and Tyrion goes to speak with his
sister.
INT. CERSEI'S OFFICE - DAY
Tyrion enters. Gregor closes the door.
Cersei is seated behind her desk, which was once her father’s
desk, in the office at the far end of the room. Tyrion starts
the long walk toward her, along the small council table.
The Mountain’s heavy footfalls thud behind him. Tyrion stops. The footsteps stop. Tyrion starts again.
When Tyrion reaches the office threshold, the Mountain takes
up his post next to the Lannister lion ironwork.
Tyrion stands before his sister. Cersei regards him, but does
not speak.
CERSEI
I shouldn’t be surprised. I suppose
she’s your kind of woman: a foreign
whore who doesn't know her place.
TYRION
A foreign whore you can’t abduct,
beat or intimidate. That must be
difficult for you.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 24.
CERSEI
So you bring her here with her pet
Northerner, whom you’ve convinced
to bow down before her--
TYRION
I did not know about that--
CERSEI
-- and now you’ve got both working
towards the same goal. The goal
you’ve worked toward your entire
life--
TYRION
Cersei, I didn’t know--
CERSEI
-- the destruction of this family.
It is the same accusation she’s leveled at him for decades.
He finds it exhausting and exasperating.
TYRION
I am the one preventing that from
happening! Daenerys didn’t want to
debate and negotiate. She didn’t
want to bring you words, she wanted
to bring you fire and blood, until
I advised her otherwise. I don’t
want to destroy our family. I never
have.
CERSEI
You killed our father.
TYRION
After he sentenced me to death for
a crime I didn’t commit. (beat)
Yes, I killed him. Hate me for it
if you want. I hate myself for it, in spite of what he was, in spite
of what he did to me.
CERSEI
Oh, poor little man. Your papa was
mean to you. Do you have any idea
what you did when you fired that
crossbow? You left us open. You
laid us bare for the vultures and
the vultures came and tore us
apart.

You may not have killed Joffrey,
but you killed Myrcella, and you
killed Tommen. No one would have
touched them if father was here. No
one would have dared.
The deaths of his niece and nephew pain him deeply.
TYRION
I have never been more sorry about
anything, I--
CERSEI
I will not hear it, not from you--
TYRION
Please, just let me--
CERSEI
I will not hear it.
She means it.
TYRION
All right.
Tyrion stands, and steps over to the threshold of the office,
where the Mountain stands.
TYRION
You love your family, and I have
destroyed it. I will always be a
threat. So put an end to me.
The Mountain turns to face him. Tyrion looks up at him, then
returns his attentions to Cersei.
TYRION
If it weren’t for me, you’d have a
mother. If it weren’t for me, you’d
have a father. If it weren’t for me
you’d have two beautiful children. I’ve thought about killing you more
times than I can count. (beat)
Do it! Say the word.
He’s right. It’s within her grasp, what she’s wanted so badly
for so long. She looks to the Mountain, who looks to her,
waiting for the signal. With a nod of the head she can have
it.
She looks away.

The Mountain turns away, and Tyrion steps away from him. He
steps over to the side table, picks up a wine vase, and pours
a glass of wine for himself. He takes a very large drink.
He then pours a glass for Cersei, walks over, and sets it
down beside her. He returns to the side table for his own
wine and resumes a respectful distance on the other side of
the desk.
TYRION
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.
CERSEI
I will not (hear)--
TYRION
I don’t care. I loved them. You
know I did. You know it in your
heart, if there’s anything left of
it.
She does know. She drinks.
CERSEI
It doesn’t matter. Your love
doesn’t matter. Your feelings don’t
matter. I don’t care why you did
what you did. I only care what it
cost us. It cost us our future.
TYRION
If there’s no future, then why are
we here? Why did you allow me to
come?
CERSEI
Not to help my enemies collaborate
in my destruction.
TYRION
Yes, no not what you hoped for. But
you must have hoped for something.
He is more right than he knows. She deflects.
CERSEI
What did you hope for? To make Jon
Snow submit to your Queen?
TYRION
Not like this.

CERSEI
But eventually. You want everyone
to bend the knee to her.
TYRION
Yes.
CERSEI
Why?
TYRION
Because I think she will make the
world a better place.
CERSEI
You said she’d destroy King’s
Landing.
She makes a fair point.
TYRION
She knows herself. She chose an
advisor who would check her worst
impulses, instead of feeding them.
That’s the difference between you.
CERSEI
I don’t care about checking my
worst impulses. I don’t care about
making the world a better place. Hang the world.
Cersei folds her hands across her stomach.
CERSEI
That thing you dragged here, I know
what it is and I know what it
means. And when it came at me, I
didn’t think about the world. Not
at all. As soon as it opened its
mouth, the world disappeared for
me, right down its black throat.
Tyrion notices the barely perceptible movement of Cersei’s
bottom hand over her belly.
CERSEI
All I could think about was keeping
those gnashing teeth away from
those who mean the most to me. Away
from my family.

Tyrion sees what he sees, and knows what it means. He can
hardly believe it, but he knows it to be true.
CERSEI
Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right
idea: get on a boat, take those who
matter--
TYRION
You’re pregnant.
She stays silent for too long, long enough to tell him that
he’s right.
And once she knows he knows, she can think of nothing else to
say.
EXT. DRAGONPIT - MAIN FLOOR - DAY
Jon is pondering, looking at the detritus on the ground, when
Dany approaches. He has a small dragon jawbone in his hands.
JON
No one is less happy about this
than I am.
DANY
I know. I respect what you did. I
wish you hadn’t done it, but I
respect it.
Dany steps closer to Jon and takes the small jawbone from his
hands. Their fingers touch briefly.
DANY
This place was the beginning of the
end for my family. (in Valyrian)
Zaldrizes buzdari iksos daor. (for Jon’s benefit)
A dragon is not a slave. They were
terrifying, extraordinary, they
filled people with wonder and awe. And we locked them in here. They
wasted away. They grew small. And
we grew small as well. We weren’t
extraordinary without them. We were
just like everyone else.
Dany holds the jawbone out for Jon. He takes it and their
fingers touch again.

JON
You’re not like everyone else. And
your family hasn’t seen its end.
You’re still here.
DANY
I can’t have children.
JON
Who told you that?
DANY
The witch who murdered my husband.
JON
Has it occurred to you she might
not have been a reliable source of
information?
He scores a small smile.
DANY
You were right, from the beginning.
If I’d trusted you everything would
be different.
JON
So what now?
DANY
I can’t forget what I saw north of
the Wall. And I can’t pretend that
Cersei won’t take back half the
country the moment I march north.
JON
It appears Tyrion’s assessment was
correct. (clarifying)
We’re fucked.
They allow themselves a brief gallows laugh.
The laughter fades, but they continue to hold each others’ gaze until it is pleasantly uncomfortable.
Tyrion’s return to the Dragonpit breaks the moment.
Everyone looks at him, steps toward him.
He is expressionless, and alone.
Crests fall.

And then Cersei enters behind him, with Jaime, Qyburn, the
Mountain and the Queensguard in tow. Varys reenters as well.
CERSEI
My armies will not stand down. I
will not pull them back to the
capital.
(beat)
I will march them north, to fight
alongside you in the Great War.
The darkness is coming for us all.
We will face it together.
This is the last thing anyone expected to hear. Dany and Jon
both look at Tyrion.
Tyrion meets their gaze with a subtle expression: Tyrion
Lannister, motherfuckers.
CERSEI
And when the Great War is over,
perhaps you will remember I chose
to help with no promises or
assurances from any of you.

I expect not.
She turns to Qyburn and gives the order:
CERSEI
Call our banners. All of them.
Exit Cersei.
EXT. THE SKIES ABOVE WINTERFELL - DAY
The blizzard has reached gothic proportions.
A lone raven battles the strong winds and tumbling snow.
In the distance, the towers of Winterfell are barely visible
through the storm.

Even with a fire burning brightly in the fireplace and the
windows boarded up, it’s obviously freezing in here, and both
of them are bundled against the cold.
LITTLEFINGER
It’s not easy for ravens to fly in
these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to
send word earlier--
SANSA
No. This is the way he is. The way
he’s always been. He never asks my
opinion. Why would he start now?
LITTLEFINGER
I can’t believe he’d surrender the
Northern crown without consulting
you--
SANSA
(holding up scroll)
This is his writing! His signature!
He pledged to fight for Daenerys
Targaryen. He bent the knee!
Littlefinger moves about the room, examining an ancient First
Men carving of a wolf.
LITTLEFINGER
I’ve heard gossip that the Dragon
Queen is quite beautiful.
SANSA
What does that have to do with
anything?
LITTLEFINGER
Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
Sansa stares at him in disbelief.
SANSA
You think he wants to marry her?
LITTLEFINGER
An alliance makes sense. Together
they’d be difficult to defeat.
He lets that thought sink in for Sansa, before continuing.

LITTLEFINGER
He was named King in the North. He
can be unnamed.
Sansa glances at Littlefinger and looks away. Is she willing
to turn that far against her brother?
SANSA
Even if I wanted to... Arya would
never go along. She’s always loved
Jon. Far more than she ever loved
me. And she’d kill anyone who
betrayed her family.
LITTLEFINGER
You’re her family, too. Would Arya
really murder her own sister?
SANSA
Do you know what she is now? Do you
know what the Faceless Men are?
LITTLEFINGER
Only by reputation. They worship
the God of Death, I believe.
(shrugging)
I never trust godly men.
SANSA
They’re killers. And Arya was one
of them. (beat)
What do you think she’s after?
LITTLEFINGER
She’s your sister. You know her far
better than I ever could.
He watches Sansa for a long beat.
LITTLEFINGER
Sometimes, when I’m trying to
understand a person’s motives, I
play a little game. I assume the
worst. What's the worst reason they
could possibly have for saying what
they say, and doing what they do?
Then I ask myself: how well does
that reason explain what they say
and what they do? So tell me: What
is the worst thing she could want?

To kill me. For marrying our
enemies and betraying my family.
LITTLEFINGER
Why did she unearth the letter
Cersei made you write?
SANSA
To provide proof of my betrayals.
To provide justification, after she
murders me.
LITTLEFINGER
And after she murders you, what
does she become?
Sansa looks up at him.
SANSA
Lady of Winterfell.
Littlefinger spreads his hands. Well? There it is.
Sansa nods. There it is.
INT. DRAGONSTONE - MAP ROOM - DAY
Tyrion, Jon, Dany, Davos, Jorah, Grey Worm, Missandei, Varys
and Theon have gathered for this conference.
Jon uses the table to point out routes.

Winterfell within a fortnight.

JON
We can sail with them to White
Harbor and meet the Dothraki here
on the Kingsroad, then ride
together to Winterfell.
JORAH
Perhaps you should fly to
Winterfell, your grace. You have
many enemies in the North.
Thousands fell fighting your
father. All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow-- he’ll see
your silver hair on the Kingsroad
and know that one well-placed bolt
will make him a hero. The Man Who
Killed the Conqueror.
Dany sees the logic in this. But before she can speak:
JON
It’s your decision, your grace. But
if we’re going to be allies in this
war, it’s important for the
Northerners to see us as allies. If
we sail to White Harbor together, I
think it sends a better message.
She weighs her choice, then says to Jorah:
DANY
I’ve not come to conquer the North. I’m coming to save the North.
She turns to Jon.
DANY
We sail together.
Jon doesn’t quite smile because smiling would seem
inappropriate. But still, that almost looks like a smile.
Jorah nods in deference. But he’s not smiling at all. Fucking
punkass little shitburger stole my khaleesi!
Dany looks over the map table, in a shot reminiscent of the
end of episode 701.

Jon considers him for a beat before nodding to Davos. Davos
nods in return and walks away.
THEON
What you did in King’s Landing...
what you said...
Jon isn’t sure what Theon’s talking about and Theon himself
struggles to make himself clear.
THEON
You could have lied to Cersei.
About bending the knee to Daenerys.
You risked everything, to tell an
enemy the truth.
JON
We went down there to make peace.
And it seems to me we need to be
honest with each other if we’re
going to fight together.
Theon stares at the floor. He hates himself in this moment, he truly does.
THEON
You’ve always known what was right. Even when we were all young and
stupid, you always knew. Every step
you take, it’s always the right
step.
JON
It's not. It may seem that way from
the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

family.
THEON
It always seemed like there was...
like there was an impossible choice
I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.

Our father was more of a father to
you than yours ever was.
THEON
He was.
JON
And you betrayed him. Betrayed his
memory.

me.
Theon looks up at Jon.
THEON
But the things I’ve done...
JON
It's not my place to forgive you
for all of it. But what I can
forgive, I do. You don't need to
choose. You're a Greyjoy. And
you're a Stark.

The IRONBORN prepare to set sail, with HARRAG giving orders.
The Ironborn quiet down when they see Theon approaching.
Theon faces the men, whose expressions are flat and hostile.
Whatever natural leadership abilities Theon once possessed,
he lost them a long time ago.
THEON
All of us chose to follow Yara. We
left the Iron Islands for Yara. She
would never leave one of us behind.
We’re not leaving her behind.
HARRAG
Your sister’s dead.
THEON
She’s not dead.
HARRAG
She’s dead. Even if Euron hasn’t
cut her throat yet, she’s dead.
THEON
She’s our queen--
HARRAG
She’s your sister. And you left her
to die.
The men nod. Little shit abandoned his own sister.
THEON
I did. I ran from my uncle. I was a
coward.
Harrag steps closer to him.
HARRAG
So why in fuck’s name should we
listen to you? They say the dead
can’t swim. We’re gonna sail east,
find a nice quiet island, kill all
the men and take their wives for
ourselves.

THEON
Yara did. She made a pledge. We’re
going to find her. And we’re going
to set her free.
Harrag spits in his face, a great gob of slimy, Ironborn
spittle.
Theon closes his eyes and wipes the spit from his face.
HARRAG
Run away, little Theon. That’s what
you do best.
Theon doesn’t respond. But he doesn’t look away from Harrag.
Harrag, a pit bull of a human being, finds this look
provocative.
He punches Theon in the face, hard.
Theon fights back. It’s not a pretty fight. Harrag brawls
dirty, all elbows and head butts.
He wears heavy rings on his fingers, rings he paid the iron
price for, and these do extra damage with each punch he
lands.
Theon fights with great heart, but he’s smaller and less
experienced at this type of street fighting.
He lands a few shots but none of them seem to affect his
opponent.
Harrag knocks him down with a vicious cross, opening a gash
just above Theon’s eye.
The men cheer.
Theon staggers to his feet, blood streaming down over his
eye.
Harrag attacks again. Theon tries to defend himself but is
overpowered.
Theon goes down again.

This time the cheers are a bit sparser.
Harrag pants as he stares down at Theon. The big man is
getting winded.
HARRAG
Stay down or I’ll kill you.
Theon-- bleeding from the nose, the mouth, from the deep gash
above his eye-- rises to his feet again.
He’s having a hard time seeing, he’s so bloodied. But he
throws himself at Harrag, trying to land a good shot.
Harrag knocks him down a third time.
Harrag himself is so exhausted now he bends over, hands on
his knees, watching Theon.
The Ironborn watch Theon, too. He might not be the world’s
greatest fighter. But fuck, he’s not quitting.
Theon, his face a bloody mess, rises to his feet a third
time.
Harrag takes a deep breath. He charges at Theon, throwing
everything he’s got left at his adversary.
Clutching Theon’s face in his big, dirty hands, Harrag slams
his knee into Theon’s groin.
But Theon has no balls.
Just the slightest possible smile from Theon, as he receives
his first ever benefit from castration.
He slams his forehead into Harrag’s nose, the single greatest
headbutt in the history of filmed headbutts.
Harrag staggers back, hands covering the streaming mess of
his nose.
Theon tackles him and proceeds to ground and pound the living
shit out of the big man, who is too tired to defend himself.
Soon Harrag lies motionless on the beach.
Theon stands. He looks like he’s just been spat out of a
thresher.
He nearly falls but one of the Ironborn men catches him and
holds him.

Sansa stands alone, staring across the snow-shrouded moors.
She wears a hood to protect her from the wind and the snow,
making her look like the French Lieutenant’s Woman, a
reference Sophie Turner will just have to Google.
We don’t have access to her interior monologue, but we’re
looking at Dark Sansa here, that much is clear.
She closes her eyes for a beat, then opens them.
The decision has been made.
She turns and walks back toward the towers.
As she passes a waiting STARK GUARD:
SANSA
Have my sister brought to the great
hall.
The Guard nods and Sansa keeps walking, never looking back, never checking her stride.
INT. WINTERFELL GREAT HALL - DAY
ARYA STARK walks into the great hall, escorted by two STARK
GUARDS.
Sansa sits at the high table. Bran sits by her side, in his
wheelchair. He watches Arya with no trace of brotherly
affection.
MAESTER WOLKAN stands near the high table.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 41.
LORD ROYCE stands on one side of the room, and dozens of
KNIGHTS OF THE VALE stand by the walls, watching Arya.
Arya glances at the Knights of the Vale on either side of
her. Far more men than she could kill, and all of them loyal
to Sansa.
She sees Littlefinger leaning against the wall, in the same
position where he stood at the end of 610. Watching Arya with
the faintest trace of a smile.
Not a good sign, Arya. She glances behind her as the door is
shut and Knights of the Vale fill the gap. Surrounded on all
sides.
The room is very quiet. Arya looks at her sister.
ARYA
Are you sure you want to do this?
A beat before Sansa replies.
SANSA
It’s not what I want. It’s what
honor demands.
Arya smiles.
ARYA
And what does honor demand?
SANSA
That I defend my family from those
who would harm us. That I defend
the north from those who would
betray us.
Arya nods. She glances at Littlefinger, who stares back at
her. She looks at Lord Royce. No love there. Bran, her baby
brother? Nothing.
ARYA
All right, then. Get on with it.
SANSA
You stand accused of murder. You
stand accused of treason.
Sansa’s eyeline shifts.
SANSA
How do you answer these charges,
Lord Baelish?

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 42.
Littlefinger stiffens, as everyone in the room looks at him.
Everyone else is in on it. For once, Littlefinger is the man
on the outside.
As if caught in a bad dream, he cannot speak for a moment.
ARYA
My sister asked you a question.
LITTLEFINGER
Lady Sansa... forgive me. I’m a bit
confused--
SANSA
Which charges confuse you? Let’s
start with the simplest one. You
murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You
pushed her through the Moon Door
and watched her fall. Do you deny
it?
Littlefinger stares at her, unable to process what’s
happening. He turns and sees Lord Royce staring coldly at
him.
LITTLEFINGER
I did it to protect you--
SANSA
You did it to take power in the
Vale. Earlier you conspired to
murder Jon Arryn. You gave Lysa
Tears of Lys to poison him. Do you
deny it?
Littlefinger opens his mouth but cannot speak for a beat. How
does she know this?
LITTLEFINGER
Whatever your aunt might have told
you... she was a troubled woman. She imagined enemies everywhere.
SANSA
You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to
our parents, telling them it was
the Lannisters who murdered Jon
Arryn. When really it was you.
Littlefinger is one of the coolest cucumbers in the garden,
but even he starts to sweat now. His prosecutor is armed with
information she cannot possibly know.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 43.
SANSA
The conflict between the Starks and
the Lannisters, it was you who
started it. Do you deny it?
LITTLEFINGER
I know of no such letter.
SANSA
You conspired with Cersei Lannister
and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our
father, Ned Stark. Thanks to your
treachery he was imprisoned and
later executed on false charges of
treason. Do you deny it?
The walls are closing in on Littlefinger. But he’s not going
down without a fight.
LITTLEFINGER
I deny it. None of you were there
to see what happened. None of you
knows the truth--
BRAN
You held a knife to his throat. You
said, “I did warn you not to trust
me.”
Littlefinger looks at Bran. And now he understands how all
his crimes have come to light.
Arya draws the Valyrian steel dagger.
ARYA
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister. But
that was another one of your lies. It was yours.
Littlefinger sees the steel glint in the torchlight.
He turns back to Sansa.
LITTLEFINGER
Lady Sansa. I’ve known you since
you were a girl. I’ve protected
you--
SANSA
Protected me? By selling me to the
Boltons?
CONTINUED: (3)

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 44.
LITTLEFINGER
If we could speak alone, I can
explain everything.
SANSA
Sometimes, when I’m trying to
understand a person’s motives, I
play a little game. I assume the
worst. What's the worst reason you
have for turning me against my
sister? But that’s what you do,
isn’t it? That’s what you’ve always
done. Turn family against family,
turn sister against sister. That’s
what you did to our mother and Aunt
Lysa. And that’s what you tried to
do to us.
LITTLEFINGER
Sansa. Please.
SANSA
I’m a slow learner, it’s true. But
I learn.
LITTLEFINGER
Give me a chance to defend myself.
I deserve that.
Seeing no hint of mercy on Sansa’s face he turns to Lord
Royce.
LITTLEFINGER
I am Lord Protector of the Vale and
I command you to escort me safely
back to the Eyrie.
Lord Royce stares at Littlefinger. He would behead the man
himself, but it’s not his place.
LORD ROYCE
I think not.
Littlefinger realizes too late that the best laid plans gang
aft agley, an' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain.
He sinks to his knees.
LITTLEFINGER
Sansa. I beg you. I loved your
mother since the time I was a boy.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 45.
SANSA
And yet you betrayed her.
LITTLEFINGER
I loved you more than anyone.
SANSA
And yet you betrayed me.
Sansa stands.
SANSA
When you brought me back to
Winterfell, you told me there’s no
justice in the world. Not unless we
make it.
She nods to Arya.
Littlefinger glances at the Stark girl, who now walks toward
him, a petite executioner, dagger in hand.
SANSA
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never
forget them.
LITTLEFINGER
Sansa--
Arya swipes the dagger across his throat so fast he doesn't
see it happening until it's over.
He falls face forward to the floor, clutching at his throat, trying to keep his life blood from spilling out.
Everyone in the great hall watches him die. And no one moves
a muscle to help him.
INT. RED KEEP - MAP ROOM - DAY
Jaime is in the midst of giving orders to LANNISTER GENERALS.
JAIME
Our men in King’s Landing will
march north in three days time.
As Jaime continues to speak, we cut to the second level of
the large room. Cersei, trailed by the Mountain, approaches
the balcony looking over the huge painted map and looks down
at the men below.

LANNISTER GENERAL
It’ll take us a fortnight just to
gather supplies for the train--
JAIME
We don’t have a fortnight. If the
north falls, we fall. Three days.
Cersei steps away from the balcony and moves for the stairs,
followed by the Mountain.
JAIME
The remaining forces in the
Westerlands will take the River
Road east. We’ll meet at Lord
Harroway’s Town, and march together
to Winterfell.
CERSEI
Ser Jaime.
Jaime glances over to where Cersei now approaches, trailed by
her fearsome bodyguard.
JAIME
Your grace.
CERSEI
My lords. I need a moment with my
brother.
The Generals bow to their queen and depart.
Cersei waits for them to go before turning on Jaime.
The Mountain waits at a respectful distance, always watching
Jaime.
CERSEI
What are you doing?
JAIME
Preparing the expedition north.
CERSEI
The expedition north.
(beat)
I always knew you were the
stupidest Lannister.
Jaime opens his mouth but quickly closes it. Painful
experience has taught him not to interrupt Cersei when she’s
about to begin a rant.

GAME OF THRONES "The Dragon and the Wolf" 47.
CERSEI
The Starks and Targaryens have
united against us-- and you want to
fight alongside them? Are you a
traitor or an idiot?
JAIME
You pledged our forces [to fight
our common]--
CERSEI
(speaking over him)
I will say whatever I need to say
to insure the survival of our
House. You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father? You
expect me to command our troops to
fight beside foreign scum? To fight
for the Dragon Queen?
JAIME
You saw it with your own eyes. You
saw a dead man trying to kill us.
CERSEI
And I saw it burn. If dragons can’t
stop them, if Dothraki and
Unsullied and Northmen can’t stop
them, how will our army make a
difference?
JAIME
This isn’t about noble houses. This
is about the living and the dead--
CERSEI
And I intend to stay amongst the
living! Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the north. We stay
here, where we’ve always been.
JAIME
I made a promise--
She approaches him, trying a gentler tack, looking up at his
bewildered face.
CERSEI
Our child will rule Westeros.
JAIME
Our child will never be born, if
the dead come south.

CERSEI
The monsters are real. The White
walkers. The dragons. The Dothraki
screamers-- all the frightening
stories we heard when we were
young, they’re all real. So be it.
Let the monsters kill each other.
While they battle in the north,
we’ll take back the lands that
belong to us.
JAIME
And then what?
CERSEI
And then we rule.
JAIME
When the fight in the north is
over, someone wins. You understand
that, don’t you? If the dead win,
they march south and kill us all.
If the living win and we’ve
betrayed them, they march south and
kill us all.
CERSEI
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all. Most
of them will die in the north.
JAIME
I faced them in the field. We can’t
beat them. We can’t beat their
dragons--
CERSEI
How many dragons did you see at the
pit?
Jaime’s not sure what she’s getting at.
JAIME
Two.
CERSEI
What happened to the third?
JAIME
For all we know it’s guarding her
fleet.

She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied --
she came to show us all her power.
No, something happened. The dragons
are vulnerable.
Cersei’s intransigence frustrates Jaime. He’s battled these
forces on the field. He knows what they’re up against.
JAIME
We can’t beat the Dothraki. We
don’t have the numbers, we don’t
have the support of the other
houses.
CERSEI
We have something better. We have
the Iron Bank.
Jaime can only stare at her.
CERSEI
You should have listened more when
father spoke about the importance
of gold. Oh, I know it was boring
for you. You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight. But I listened. I learned. (beat)
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos. The Golden
Company. 20,000 men, horses... elephants, I believe.
JAIME
The Golden Company is not here. They are in Essos. How is a
mercenary company in Essos going to
help us?
CERSEI
Did you really think Euron Greyjoy
turned tail and sailed back to the
Iron Islands? Do you think he
abandoned the chance to marry the
Queen?

the war for Westeros.
JAIME
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy.
Without telling me. The commander
of your armies.
CERSEI
And you conspired with Tyrion, the
man who murdered our father.
Without telling me. Your queen.
JAIME
I didn’t conspire with him!
CERSEI
You met him in secret, without my
consent. You planned to promote my
enemies’ interests. That is the
definition of conspiracy.
JAIME
I pledged to ride north. I intend
to honor that pledge.
CERSEI
And that would be treason.
JAIME
Treason?!
CERSEI
Disobeying your Queen’s command. Fighting with her enemies. What
would you call it?
Jaime considers his response for a long beat, staring at his
sister, his lover, his queen.
JAIME
It doesn’t matter what I’d call it.
He turns to go but finds that the Mountain stands directly in
his way.

I’m the only one you have left. Our
children are gone. Our father is
gone. It’s just me and you now.
CERSEI
There’s one more yet to come.
Jaime nods.
JAIME
Give the order, then.
He watches her and waits.
The Mountain waits for a command from his queen.
She nods. The smallest possible nod.
The Mountain draws his sword.
Jaime knows there’s no point fighting. He knows he will be
cut in half.
He stares at his sister for a long beat.
JAIME

I don’t believe you.
After a long beat, Jaime turns and walks away, right past the
Mountain and his drawn sword.
Cersei watches. She does not give the command.
EXT. OUTSIDE KING'S LANDING - DAY
Jaime rides north, the city behind him.
He’s no longer wearing his Lannister uniform. He’s no longer
commanding an army, or representing his house. He’s dressed
so as not to stand out, in the manner of Bronn, a sellsword
with no affiliations.

black leather glove (specially designed for his golden hand).
As he finishes he notices a single snowflake landing on the
black leather.
He looks up at the overcast sky. He glances back at the
capital, and the high towers of the Red Keep.
He trots forward, never looking back again, a lone horseman
heading north on the Kingsroad.

Why did you come to Winterfell?
SAMWELL
Jon’s the one to lead the fight
against the dead. I know he is. But
he can’t do it alone. So I’ve come
here to help him.
Bran weighs this, and deems it acceptable.
BRAN
He’s on his way back to Winterfell. With Daenerys Targaryen.

father's son. He's the son of
Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt,
Lyanna Stark.
Sam stares at Bran for a long beat. What he’s just heard, if
true, is news that changes everything.
Bran looks away.

He was born in a tower in Dorne.
His last name isn’t really Snow.
It’s Sand.

When we pull back, we realize we’re no longer in Bran’s room.
We’re in:
EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY
Bran watches
RHAEGAR TARGARYEN, silver-haired, tall and handsome. He
stands by LYANNA STARK, both of them nervous but happy.
Lyanna looks up into Rhaegar’s eyes as HIGH SEPTON MAYNARD
binds their hands with the wedding wrap in a ceremony that
should look quite similar to the marriage of Robb Stark and
Talisa.
Their love for each other would be obvious to any bystander.
Bran stands close by, watching them say the words:
RHAEGAR
Father. Smith. Warrior. Mother. Maiden. Crone. Stranger. I am hers, and she
is mine, from this day, until
the end of my days.
LYANNA
Father. Smith. Warrior. Mother. Maiden. Crone. Stranger. I am his, and he is
mine, from this day, until

LYANNA
His name is Aegon Targaryen. You
have to protect him. Promise me, Ned.
INT. DANY'S CABIN - LATER
We crawl up the swirling bedclothes to
Dany and Jon, making love. Jon is on top.
BRAN (V.O.)
He’s never been a bastard.
Their faces are inches apart. Their eyes are wide open.

Sansa nods.

he loved me.
Arya shrugs. She doesn’t have any angst about it.

In winter, we must protect
ourselves, look after one another.
Sansa knows those words.

EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
As before, we fly to the Wall with a flock of birds, piloted
by Bran. A bunch of them land on the Wall battlements above
Eastwatch.
TORMUND walks the battlements, gazing north for the enemy he
knows is coming.
He looks down the battlements to BERIC, who is up here with
him, along with a few other WILDLINGS. They’ve all taken well
to the strange role of serving as guardians of the Wall.
BERIC
It’s a long way down.
TORMUND
Eh. Crows keep telling me I’ll get
used to it.
A few NIGHT’S WATCHMEN are up here as well.
Tormund hears a strange sound, getting louder. He looks down
to the north side of the Wall. Beric looks as well.
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
Emerging from the frozen coastal forest, the ARMY OF THE DEAD
comes in force. All of them, 100,000 strong, with hundreds of
WHITE WALKER officer corps on their dead horses.
EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
One of the Night’s Watchmen runs to the large horn and blasts
three times.

forest and the Wall, the Walkers on their dead horses in
front of the wight foot soldiers.

Tormund exhales, looks to Beric. It's true, that whole thing
about them being unable to pass the Wall because of ancient
spells and such. He’ll live another day.
But then a stranger sound comes from the north. Tormund looks
to the sky, and sees a mote on the horizon, coming in fast.
Very fast.
It's moving so fast we don't get a clear look at it or the
NIGHT KING on its back before it is upon us...
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
...hitting the Wall with a blast of blue flame.
Bran's meaningful birds take flight.
A massive chunk of the Wall breaks free ahead of Tormund. The
ice dragon glides away, and we get our first clear look at
him, and at the Night King on his back. He's done the same
thing to Viserion that he did to Craster's sons. Only those
were babies, and this is a dragon.
EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY
TORMUND
(shouting a command)
Run! Run!
Tormund and Beric lead their wildling comrades to the stairs
carved in the ice -- Eastwatch has a massive zig-zag
stairway, not an elevator like Castle Black.
They run for their lives and disappear from view.
EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL
The Night King and his dragon circle back, coming in for the
kill.
Hovering near the base of the Wall, the ice dragon shoots
forth a steady stream of blue fire, thick as a tree trunk,
strafing back and forth along the base of the Wall.
The Wall cannot withstand the fire. Thunderously, it begins
to give way, sending pieces falling into the sea like a
calving iceberg.

opened, one large enough to admit the Army of the Dead, all
100,000 of them. And the White Walkers. And the Night King,
flying low over their heads, into the camera --
-- and away from it. All of them heading south, for the world
of men.
